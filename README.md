# tech_layoffs_Analysis
Analysis done on the dataset using mysql
The dataset comprehensively covers layoff information by tech companies from 2020 to 2024. It includes details on company names, regions, countries, industries, employee count, layoff stages, and the company size before and after the layoffs.
Using mysql as a query language I have done analysis on the data and have amazing insights about the data.
